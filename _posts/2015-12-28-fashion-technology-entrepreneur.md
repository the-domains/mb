2015 has been an exciting year, '**[Looks Good On Me][0]**' has made impressive progress, and the future is looking bright. The business won best startup in the prestigious 'Prince Abdulaziz Bin Abdullah International Award for Entrepreneurs' competition, and we have been heralded as a game changer by 'London's Disrupt Magazine'. 

Partnerships with Google and leading fashion brands have given us a strong platform to grow over the next 12 months. 

2016 will mark a significant ramp up of our development. I am really looking forward to the journey ahead and will use this site to post updates and to discuss points of interest. 

To be an entrepreneur is tough, the road is never smooth and for every setback there is a glowing success around the corner. The key is to never lose faith in your vision, to build a fantastic team, and to stay focussed on the end goal. 

Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like me to speak at an event or feel there is potential for us to work together. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fe1ad2c6-ec01-451b-bb62-6681673d141d.png)
